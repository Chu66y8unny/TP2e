# Preface

- And they all suffered from the **trapdoor** effect: they would start out 
  easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 **the bottom 
  would fall out**.
- I needed a title, so on a **whim** I chose How to Think Like a Computer 
  Scientist.
- The result is this book, now with the less **grandiose** title Think Python.
- More than 100 **sharp-eyed** and thoughtful readers have sent in 
  suggestions and corrections over the past few years.
- Christoph Zwerschke sent several corrections and **pedagogic** suggestions, 
  and explained the difference between gleich and selbe.

# C1

- **The penny dropped.**
- The difference between formal and natural language is like the difference 
  between poetry and **prose**,
- Prose is more **amenable** to analysis than poetry but still often 
  ambiguous. 
- For **whimsical** reasons, programming errors are called 
  bugs and the process of tracking them down is called debugging.
- If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, 
  **despondent**, or embarrassed. 
- When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are 
  **obstinate** or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, 
  obstinate people
- One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with certain 
  strengths, like speed and precision, and particular weaknesses, like lack of 
  **empathy** and inability to grasp the big picture.
- Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the 
  strengths and **mitigate** the weaknesses.

# C2

- **warbler**

# C3

- When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however 
  **improbable**, must be the truth.

# C4

- **isosceles**
- **spoke**
